# music-genre-classifier

The music genre classifier is developed using Python and machine learning techniques, specifically a logistic regression model. The goal is to categorize music tracks into different genres based on data science principles.

The process involves:
1. Data Collection: Gathering a dataset containing music tracks and their corresponding genre labels.

2. Feature Extraction: Transforming audio characteristics (e.g., tempo, pitch, rhythm) into numerical features that the model can understand.

3. Data Preprocessing: Cleaning, normalizing, and splitting the data into training and testing sets.

4. Model Selection: Opting for logistic regression as the classification algorithm due to its simplicity and suitability for multiclass problems.

5. Model Training: Fitting the logistic regression model on the training data, where the input features are the extracted characteristics, and the output is the predicted genre label.

6. Model Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score on the testing data.

7. Fine-tuning: Adjusting model hyperparameters or exploring feature engineering to improve classification accuracy.

8. Prediction: Deploying the trained model to predict the genre of new music tracks.

By using logistic regression and data science techniques, the music genre classifier becomes capable of effectively categorizing music tracks into specific genres based on their extracted features, contributing to automated music organization and recommendation systems.
